# **Cube RGB with dimensions 5x5x5**

Project based on KL05Z

The aim of the project was to create a cube where games such as snake can be played and various visual effects can be shown.

# System operation:
When you turn on KL05Z board it starts a 3D snake game. It can be seen on the cube as moving 3 LEDs, where blue LED is the head of the snake and the green LEDs are body. The yellow light indicates the food that the snake is collecting. Snake can pick food only with its head and when food is picked his body is lengthened by one.

# Implemented functions:
1. Setting the color and light intensity on the selected diode
2. Setting the color of the selected LED in the color mapping of the cube
3. Creating a line at a selected position and length in the cube mapping
4. Sending the color map to the cube
<br />
Additionally, 5 visual effects have been created that are located in the library created for the cube
